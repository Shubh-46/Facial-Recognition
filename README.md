1.Introduction
Facial recognition technology has a wide range of applications including security systems, authentication processes, and more. This project utilizes the face_recognition library, which is built on top of dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition technology.

2.Features
Detect faces in images and videos
Recognize and identify known faces
Support for batch processing of multiple images
High accuracy and performance

3.Installation
To use this facial recognition system, you need to have Python 3 and pip installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to install the required dependencies:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4.Usage
Command Line
You can use the provided command-line tool to recognize faces in images.

Detect Faces
To detect faces in an image, use the following command:
python detect_faces.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg

Recognize Faces
To recognize faces in an image based on known faces:
python recognize_faces.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg --known_faces_dir path/to/known_faces

Python Script
You can also use the face_recognition library directly in your Python scripts. Here's an example:
import face_recognition

# Load the image
image = face_recognition.load_image_file("path/to/your/image.jpg")

# Find all face locations in the image
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)

# Find all face encodings in the image
face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(image, face_locations)

for face_encoding in face_encodings:
    # Compare face encodings with known faces
    matches = face_recognition.compare_faces(known_face_encodings, face_encoding)
    # Do something with the matches

5.Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the system:
Detecting Faces in an Image
Recognizing Faces from a Directory of Known Faces
